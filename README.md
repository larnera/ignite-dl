```


## Usage

Download all slidedecks by passing in the RSS addresses:

"use strict";
let ignite_dl = require("ignite-dl");

let ig = new ignite_dl.ignite({
    maxConcurrentDownloads: 8,
    slidesAddresses: ['http://s.ch9.ms/events/ignite/2016/rss/slides',
                      'http://s.ch9.ms/events/ignite/2016/rss/slides?page=2']
    })
     ig.download('slides');
```

let ignite_dl = require("ignite-dl");

let ig = new ignite_dl.ignite({
    maxConcurrentDownloads: 8,
      videosAddresses: ['http://s.ch9.ms/events/ignite/2016/rss/mp4high',
                        'http://s.ch9.ms/events/ignite/2016/rss/mp4high?page=2']

"use strict";
let ignite_dl = require("ignite-dl");

let ig = new ignite_dl.ignite({
    maxConcurrentDownloads: 8,
    slidesAddresses: ['http://s.ch9.ms/events/ignite/2016/rss/slides',
                      'http://s.ch9.ms/events/ignite/2016/rss/slides?page=2'],
    proxy: {
        domain: 'yourDomain',
        username: 'yourUserName',
        password: 'yourPassword',
        addressePort: 'proxyaddress:80'
